# Lab 1 - Longest Palindromic Substring

## What is a Palindrome

A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters that reads the same forward and backward.  
Examples of palindromic words are "level", "radar", and "madam". Palindromes can also be longer phrases or sentences, such as "A man, a plan, a canal, Panama!" or "Never odd or even".

## Exercise
In the given string, your task is to identify and return the longest palindromic substring.  
A palindromic substring is a contiguous sequence of characters existing within the string s that reads the same forward and backward.  
If multiple palindromic substrings of the same maximum length exist, return the one that appears first.

### Lab1_1
The lab is to have a function that propose the longest Palindromic substring of an input string, with some constrains

### Lab1_2
This lab is the same as Lab1_1 written in C++. Re-write your Python algorithm in C++, and then check the performances differences between C++ and Python on the same algorithm.

### Lab1_3
This lab is to propose an optimisation of the Lab1_1 by reducing the complexity by one power of n.
