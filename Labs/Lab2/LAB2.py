LAB 2 - Implement Software Carbon Intensity - Solution
You will now do an implementation of the GSFâ€™s Software Carbon Intensity (SCI) formula and evaluate the carbon emissions of running software. 
You will rely only on the open source Cloud Carbon Footprint (CCF) specs:
https://www.cloudcarbonfootprint.org/docs/methodology/#summary

A set of data is provided in input. 
These data represent the resources utilization of an application running in Microsoft Azure over a given period of time.

You will have to determine:
- the power consumption of each hardware resource,
- the embodied emissions,
- the total carbon emissions.
There is a bonus section for calculating the energy consumption of network and storage resources.

Hypothesis:
- The job is monothreaded.
- We assume the computation is executed in Azure, Microsoft's Cloud Service Provider, on a DS2 v2 Virtual Machine, of the D1s-5s v2 series.
- For each constant, consider the average values corresponding to the Cloud Service Provider.
- For the memory energy consumption, we will consider that none of it was implicitly included in the CPU energy consumption, and thus will consider all the given value in the input as excess memory.
- For the carbon intensity, we will consider a constant value of the region (West Europe) where the Azure cluster is deployed.
- Load factor is not provided. Fallback to the average value.
- Beware of the Azure PUE! Take the worst average value documented.
- In the Embodied Emissions formula, the TR factors represent different SCI factors.
