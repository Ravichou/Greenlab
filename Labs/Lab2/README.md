# Lab 2 - Implement Software Carbon Intensity

## Introduction
You will now do an implementation of the GSFâ€™s Software Carbon Intensity (SCI) formula and evaluate the carbon emissions of running software. 
You will rely only on the open source [Cloud Carbon Footprint (CCF) specs](https://www.cloudcarbonfootprint.org/docs/methodology/#summary)

A set of data is provided in input. 
These data represent the resources utilization of an application running in Microsoft Azure over a given period of time.

## Exercise

You will have to determine:
- the power consumption of each hardware resource,
- the embodied emissions,
- the total carbon emissions.  

There is a bonus section for calculating the energy consumption of network and storage resources.
